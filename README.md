## README for Dog and Cat Image Classification using CNN

### Project Overview

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to classify images of dogs and cats. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, the project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a deep learning model for image classification tasks. The repository includes all necessary steps from data preparation to model evaluation.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, specifically from the dataset titled "Cats and Dogs for Classification" by Dinesh Piyasamara. It consists of 10,000 images divided into training, validation, and test sets.

### Libraries and Tools

The project utilizes several Python libraries:
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualization.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **OpenDatasets**: For downloading the Kaggle dataset.

### Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
- `data/`: Directory containing the downloaded dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code for the model architecture and utility functions.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

### Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dog-cat-classification-cnn.git
   cd dog-cat-classification-cnn
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset**:
   Use the `OpenDatasets` library to download the dataset from Kaggle:
   ```python
   import opendatasets as od
   od.download("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dineshpiyasamara/cats-and-dogs-for-classification")
   ```

4. **Set Up Directories**:
   Organize the dataset into training and test directories as required by the project.

### Data Preparation

Load and preprocess the data using TensorFlow's `image_dataset_from_directory` function. Ensure the images are resized to (128, 128) pixels and split into training, validation, and test sets.

### Data Augmentation

Apply data augmentation techniques such as random flipping, rotation, and zoom to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting.

### Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout for regularization, and batch normalization. The architecture is designed to extract meaningful features from the images and perform binary classification.

### Training the Model

Train the model using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. Monitor the training and validation performance over 20 epochs to ensure the model is learning effectively.

### Performance Analysis

Visualize the training history to analyze the model's performance. Plot the training and validation loss, as well as accuracy metrics over the epochs to identify any potential overfitting.

### Model Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset. Calculate precision, recall, and accuracy metrics to quantify the model's effectiveness.

### Results

The CNN model achieved high accuracy in classifying dog and cat images, demonstrating the potential of deep learning for image classification tasks.

### Conclusion

This project showcases the application of Convolutional Neural Networks in image classification. By leveraging a well-structured dataset and employing data augmentation techniques, the model successfully distinguished between images of dogs and cats. This repository serves as a foundation for further exploration and fine-tuning of deep learning models for various classification tasks.

### Future Work

Future improvements could include:
- Fine-tuning the model architecture for better performance.
- Experimenting with different data augmentation techniques.
- Applying the model to other image classification problems.
